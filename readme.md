Restricted Rockets is a simple datapack that allows you to restrict how many rockets players can use
while flying with an elytra before having to land again. Once a player uses more than the maximum
amount of rockets, they will immediately stop flying and won't be able to fly again until they land.
Players can either land or be still in water to reset their rockets preemptively. See Operator
Commands below on how to set the max rockets value.

## Building

This project uses special syntax from
[Shorthand Commands](https://github.com/antD97/ShorthandCommands). To build from this project from
source:

1. Download Shorthand Commands v1.0
2. Copy `header.txt` to the Shorthand Commands directory
3. Set `project` in the `shorthand.conf` file to this project's directory
4. Run `run.bat`

# Operator Commands

`/function restricted_rockets:op/clear_all`  
Removes all scoreboard objectives, scheduled functions, and entities with custom tags. The next time
the datapack is reloaded, the datapack will run like it did the first time.

`/scoreboard players set global restricted_rockets_max_rockets <x>`  
Sets the number of rockets a player can use before landing to \<x>. Default is 0.
