Restricted Rockets is a simple datapack that restricts how many rockets players can use while flying with an elytra
before having to land again. Once a player uses more than the maximum amount of rockets, their elytra will temporarily
break. Once the player either lands or is still in water, the elytra will return to its previous state. Players can also
land or be still in water before they reach the maximum rockets to reset their flight preemptively.

This pack has configurable options that can be set globally for all players or optionally overridden by players. Server
operators can set certain settings as overridable or not overridable by non-operator players to either enforce a
specific ruleset or allow players to match their preferences. See the configuration section below for details.

How this affects gameplay:
- Incentives more creative methods of transportation that require infrastructure
- Longer duration rockets become more value (if max rockets is set to one or more)

Notes:
- Temporarily broken elytra that end up in the player's inventory can be restored by being equipped
- Elytra with customized lore will have that lore removed when temporarily broken

## Building

This project uses special syntax from [Shorthand Commands](https://github.com/antD97/ShorthandCommands). To build from
this project from source:

1. Download Shorthand Commands v1.0
2. Copy `header.txt` to the Shorthand Commands directory
3. Set `project` in the `shorthand.conf` file to this project's directory
4. Run `run.bat`

# Configuration

Server-wide rules can be modified by operators using: `/function restricted_rockets:op/config`  
Player-specific rules can be modified by anyone using: `/trigger restricted_rockets_config`

Aqua values that appear in the menu can be modified by being clicked.
Clicking on the aqua values suggests a command to modify that value. The change will be made after sending the command,
and, to see the change, the config menu has to be reopened using the config menu command.

Operators can also remove all scoreboard objectives, and scheduled functions with
`/function restricted_rockets:op/uninstall`. The next time the datapack is reloaded, the datapack will run like it did
the first time.

## Server-Wide Config

**Max rockets (default: 3):** The number of rockets players are permitted to use before having to land/be still in
water.  
**Allow client override (default: false):** Whether players are allowed to configure their own "max rockets" value.
Players are forced to use the server wide max rockets value otherwise.

**Safe elytra break (default: true):** Whether slow falling is activated on players whose elytra was temporarily broken
after using more than the max number of rockets.  
**Allow client override (default: true):** Whether players are allowed to configure their own "safe elytra break" value.
Players are forced to use the server wide "safe elytra break" value otherwise.

**Rockets tip (default: true):** Whether the "remaining rockets" actionbar text is displayed on initial flight, rocket
use, and rocket reset.  
**Zero rockets tip persists (default: true):** Whether the "remaining rockets" actionbar text is *always* displayed when
there are no more rockets left to use.

*Note that the rocket tip options can always be overridden through player-specific configuration.*

## Player-Specific Config

**Override server max rockets (default: false):** *This option will only appear if "allow client override" is enabled*
*on the server.* Whether or not to override the server "max rockets" value.  
**Override value (default: 0):** *This option will only appear if "override server max rockets" is true.* The number of
rockets this player is permitted to use before having to land/be still in water.

**Override server safe elytra break (default: false):** *This option will only appear if "allow client override" is*
*enabled on the server.* Whether or not to override the server "safe elytra break" value.  
**Override value (default: false):** *This option will only appear if "override server safe elytra break" is true.*
Whether slow falling is activated on this player if the elytra is temporarily broken after using more than the max
number of rockets.

**Override server rockets tip (default:false):** Whether or not to override the server "rockets tip" value.  
**Override value (default: false):** *This option will only appear if "override rockets tip" is true.* Whether the
"remaining rockets" actionbar text is displayed on initial flight, rocket use, and rocket reset.

**Override server zero rockets tip persists (default: false):** Whether or not to override the server "zero rockets tip
persists" value.  
**Override value (default: false):** *This option will only appear if "override server zero rockets tip persists" is*
*true.* Whether the "remaining rockets" actionbar text is *always* displayed when there are no more rockets left to use.
