Restricted Rockets is a simple datapack that restricts how many rockets players can use while flying with an elytra
before having to land again. Once a player uses more than the maximum amount of rockets, their elytra will temporarily
break. Once the player either lands or is still in water, the elytra will return to its previous state. Players can also
land or be still in water before they reach the maximum rockets to reset their flight preemptively.

How this affects gameplay:
- Incentivizes more creative methods of transportation that require infrastructure
- Longer duration rockets become more valuable (if max rockets is set to one or more)

This pack has configurable options that can be set globally for all players or optionally overridden by players. Server
operators have the ability to chose which of these settings can be overridden to either enforce a specific ruleset or to
allow players to match their preferences. See the configuration section below for details.

Notes:
- Temporarily broken elytra that end up in the player's inventory can be restored by being equipped
- Elytra with customized lore will have that lore removed when temporarily broken

## Building

This project uses special syntax from [Shorthand Commands](https://github.com/antD97/ShorthandCommands). To build from
this project from source:

1. Download Shorthand Commands v1.0
2. Copy `header.txt` to the Shorthand Commands directory
3. Set `project` in the `shorthand.conf` file to this project's directory
4. Run `run.bat`

# Configuration

Server-wide rules can be modified by operators using: `/function restricted_rockets:op/config`  
Player-specific rules can be modified by anyone using: `/trigger restricted_rockets_config`

Clicking on values in aqua will suggest a command to modify that value. The change will be made after sending the
command. For the menu to reflect the change, it must be reopened using the config menu command.

Operators can also remove all scoreboard objectives and scheduled functions with
`/function restricted_rockets:op/uninstall`. The next time the datapack is reloaded, the datapack will run like it did
the first time.

## Server-Wide Configuration

- `Max rockets` (default: 3)
  - The number of rockets players are permitted to use before having to land/be still in water.
- `Allow client override` (default: false)
  - Whether players are allowed to configure their own "max rockets" value. Players are forced to use the server wide
    "max rockets" value otherwise.

- `Safe elytra break` (default: true)
  - Whether slow falling is activated on players whose elytra was temporarily broken after using more than the max
    number of rockets.  
- `Allow client override` (default: true)
  - Whether players are allowed to configure their own "safe elytra break" value. Players are forced to use the server
    wide "safe elytra break" value otherwise.

- `Rockets tip` (default: true)
  - Whether the "remaining rockets" actionbar text is displayed on initial flight, rocket use, and rocket reset.  
- `Zero rockets tip persists` (default: true)
  - Whether the "remaining rockets" actionbar text is *always* displayed when there are no more rockets left to use.

*Note that the rocket tip options can always be overridden through player-specific configuration.*

## Player-Specific Configuration

- `Override server max rockets` (default: false)
  - Whether or not to override the server "max rockets" value.
  - *This option will only appear if "allow client override" is enabled on the server.*
  - `Override value` (default: 0)
    - The number of rockets this player is permitted to use before having to land/be still in water.
    - *This option will only appear if "override server max rockets" is true.*

- `Override server safe elytra break` (default: false)
  - Whether or not to override the server "safe elytra break" value.
  - *This option will only appear if "allow client override" is enabled on the server.*
  - `Override value` (default: false)
    - Whether slow falling is activated on this player if the elytra is temporarily broken after using more than the max
      number of rockets.
    - *This option will only appear if "override server safe elytra break" is true.*

- `Override server rockets tip` (default:false)
  - Whether or not to override the server "rockets tip" value.  
  - `Override value` (default: false)
    - Whether the "remaining rockets" actionbar text is displayed on initial flight, rocket use, and rocket reset.
    - *This option will only appear if "override rockets tip" is true.*

- `Override server zero rockets tip persists` (default: false)
  - Whether or not to override the server "zero rockets tip persists" value.  
  - `Override value` (default: false)
    - Whether the "remaining rockets" actionbar text is *always* displayed when there are no more rockets left to use.
    - *This option will only appear if "override server zero rockets tip persists" is true.*
